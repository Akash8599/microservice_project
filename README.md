Microservice_Project

Welcome to Microservice_Project, an advanced microservices architecture that seamlessly integrates Eureka service registry, Okta security, and now, with enhanced resilience features using Resilience4j. This project is a testament to the power of distributed systems, robust security, and intelligent resilience patterns, ensuring your microservices ecosystem operates with unparalleled reliability.

Overview

Microservice_Project is not just about microservicesâ€”it's about resilient microservices. Dynamic service discovery with Eureka, fortified security through Okta, and now, enhanced resilience using Resilience4j, this project is a comprehensive solution for building a robust and adaptive microservices architecture.

Key Features

Dynamic Service Discovery with Eureka: Leverage Eureka's dynamic service registration and discovery to create a flexible and scalable microservices network.

Robust Okta Security: Integrate Okta for secure authentication and authorization, safeguarding your microservices against unauthorized access and ensuring data integrity.

Enhanced Resilience with Resilience4j:

Retry Mechanism: Intelligently handle transient failures with a robust retry mechanism. Configure parameters like retry interval and maximum attempts to tailor the retry behavior to your microservices' needs.
Circuit Breaker: Safeguard against system failures by proactively opening the circuit when necessary. Experience a graceful degradation of functionality during outages, preventing cascading failures.
